<p>After building a personal apache webserver... I realized how tedious it is to maintain it, so I decided to take my docker study more seriously.


I want to give thanks to Andrei Dumitrescu for putting together a great [course] (https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-administration-build-hands-on-linux-projects/).
