SSH is a network protocol used to communicate with computers securely by encrypting messages. The remote server you are trying to access is typically called the ‘host”, while the computer you are using to access the host is called the “client”.



<strong>What are some of its uses?  </strong>

<ul>
<li>Remote access</li>
	<p> Log in to another computer from your own device. (Expect to do this 24/7 for network infrastructure management) </p>


<li>Tunneling </li>
<p> Tunneling is used to allow nonnative protocols to run through networks that normally would not support them. When you forward packets to different ports after tunneling, it is called "Port Forwarding". </p>



<li>Transfer files securely </li>
<p>The SFTP (SSH File transfer Protocol) provides a safe way to access, manage, and transfer files.  </p>

</ul>
While there some vulnerabilities found in the ssh protocol, as long as it is configured appropriately, it should still provide you a strong protection.
