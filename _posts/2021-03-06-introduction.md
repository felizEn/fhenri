SSH is a network protocol used to communicate with computers securely by encrypting messages. The remote server you are trying to access is typically called the ‘host”, while the computer you are using to access the host is called the “client”.



<strong>What are some of its uses?  </strong>

-Remote access
	-Log in to another computer from your own device. (Expect to do this 24/7 for network 	infrastructure management)


-Tunneling 
	-Used to allow nonnative protocols to run through networks that normally wouldn’t 	support them.
	-Provides security over an unsafe network
	-It can also be used to forward packets to a different port (aka port forwarding)



-Transfer files securely
	-The SFTP (SSH File transfer Protocol) provides a safe way to access, manage, and 	transfer files. 


While there some vulnerabilities found in the ssh protocol, as long as its configured appropriately, it should still provide you a strong protection.
